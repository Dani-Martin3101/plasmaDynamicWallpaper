# plasmaDynamicWallpaper
I've seen a lot of people asking how to change the wallpaper using CLI in KDE plasma, so I wrote this little script to do this task. Just add it to your PATH and execute it. The script works with absolute and relative image paths.
```sh
change-wallpaper /path/to/your/image.jpg
```
