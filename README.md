# plasmaDynamicWallpaper
I've seen a lot of people asking how to change the wallpaper using CLI in KDE plasma, so I wrote this little script to do this task. Just add it to your PATH and execute it. Please be aware that the image's path must be absolute, the script does not work with relative paths yet.
```sh
change-wallpaper /path/to/your/image.jpg
```
